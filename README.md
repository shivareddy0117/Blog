# Math for Data Science Blog

Welcome to the repository for my blog, "Math for Data Science." This blog is built using Ruby, Jekyll, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## About the Blog

This blog serves as a platform where I explore and share in-depth discussions on topics related to mathematics, statistics, and their application in data science. Whether you're a student, educator, or just curious about data science, you'll find a wealth of resources and insights here.
